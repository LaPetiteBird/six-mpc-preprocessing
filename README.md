# six-mpc-preprocessing
Implementation and evaluation of six special preprocessing protocols for secure multiparty computation (MPC) in privacy-preserving machine learning. This project benchmarks CDNN15, SecureML, SecureNN, CKRRSW20, and LowGear 2.0 using the MP-SPDZ framework.

## How to use?
1. Move the contents of Programs:Source folder in your MP-SPDZ Programs/Source folder

2. Move the input generators into main MP-SPDZ folder

3. Look at the Helper folder where all the information is written on how to run each MPC protocol.
